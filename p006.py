# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
# hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
